# OTML Weekly Briefing
## Climate conditions & rainfall outlook for Ok Tedi mine site

*`Updated: 13 Nov 2023`*

### Outline :
 - Climate background 
 - El Niño–Southern Oscillation analysis & forecast 
 - Indian Ocean Dipole analysis & forecast 
 - Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) analysis & forecast 
 - Rainfall forecasts

## SUMMARY 
- In general, drier than normal conditions are expected from November to January for Ok Tedi and greater Fly River areas (Seasonal forecast). For the Monthly forecast ACCESS-S model shows uncertainty for Middle Fly at this time. 
- El Nino is currently underway. Central and eastern Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) continue to exceed El Niño thresholds. Models indicate further warming of the central to eastern Pacific is likely. Climate models show this El Nino to peak in December and decay by at least April.
- The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is weak. Most models forecasting a return signal to Weatern Pacific or Western Hemisphere regions in the coming week with some eastward propagation possible at that point.
- A positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) continues to strengthen. A positive IOD typically can suppress NDJ rainfall over much of southern and south-eastern parts of PNG.
- The declaration of El Niño and its concurrence with the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) can have an "amplifying effect" on the country. Their combined drying effects on PNG are typically stronger and more widespread, potentially leading to reduced NDJ rainfall, therefore drier than normal conditions are likely expected for Ok Tedi and the Fly River areas.
