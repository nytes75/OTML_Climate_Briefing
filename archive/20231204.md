## SUMMARY 
- Seasonal Forecasts: The general consensus forecast for the DJF Season is leaning towards slightly above normal for Ok Tedi, Upper and Lower Fly. Forecast becomes challenging when three different seasonal predictions provide different perspectives.
- Monthly Forecasts: December forecasts in general show a slightly likely(40 - 60%) chance of below-normal rainfall for Ok Tedi and Fly. While good amounts of rainfall can be experienced, what the models are suggesting is that for the averaged over the month, it is more likely to be below average than above average. January towards February, predictions of above-normal rainfall are Likely to slightly likely.
- Weekly Forecasts: For the first week(starting 04 Dec) rainfall is likely to fall around Average to Above Average. Second week we see a likely chance of receiving Average to Below Average rainfall. At this time ECMWF forcast are performing generally better.
- The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is currently over our Region. Some models forecast the MJO with a moderate strength. MJO over the region is often associated with above average rainfall for Fly.
- El Nino is underway. Climate model forecasts indicate some further warming of SSTs to the central and eastern Pacific is likely and continue into at least April.
- The wet season is set in effect which may mean that this drying influence may be broken by rains with the NW monsoon. During the early half of the wet season, rainy periods will be less frequent or less consistent.
