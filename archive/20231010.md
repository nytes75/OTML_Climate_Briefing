# OTML Weekly Briefing
## Climate conditions & rainfall outlook for Ok Tedi mine site

*`Updated: 10 Oct 2023`*

### Outline :
 - Climate background 
 - El Niño–Southern Oscillation analysis & forecast 
 - Indian Ocean Dipole analysis & forecast 
 - Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) analysis & forecast 
 - Rainfall forecasts

## SUMMARY 
- Likely drier than normal conditions are expected from November to January for Ok Tedi and the greater Fly River areas. However the ACCESS-S model has introduced increased uncertainty for these areas at this time 
- BOM  ENSO outlook confirms an established El Nino. Central and eastern Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) continue to exceed El Niño thresholds. Models indicate further warming of the central to eastern Pacific is likely. Climate models indicate this El Niño is likely to persist until at least the end of February.
- The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is weak or indiscernible and is expected to remain weak for this next couple days. Weak MJO tends to bring less influence to Ok Tedi and Fly River areas.
- A positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is underway.  A positive IOD typically can suppress NDJ rainfall over much of southern and south-eastern parts of PNG.
- The declaration of El Niño and its concurrence with the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) can have an "amplifying effect" on the country. Their combined drying effects on PNG are typically stronger and more widespread, potentially leading to reduced NDJ rainfall, therefore drier than normal conditions are likely expected for Ok Tedi and the Fly River areas.
